# Synchronized Audio Player

### Overview
The goal of this project is to produce a simple audio player that will
allow two people to listen to an audio file in sync with each other over
the Internet. I've used the source code from [this JavaFX tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/media/jfxpub-media.htm) as a
starting point. Oracle's license for that code can be found in
[ORACLE_LICENSE.txt.](ORACLE_LICENSE.txt)

### Tech Stack
This software is built using JavaFX for the GUI and media playback
functionality. This is my first ever JavaFX project, so I'm learning as 
I go. Gradle is being used as the build system.

### Other Documents
* The changelog for this software can be found in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
* The roadmap for this software can be found in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)

### Legal Stuff
This software is licensed under the AGPL version 3. Basically, if you
change and distribute this software, you must also distribute your
modified source code, and release it under this same license. In
addition, if you host a server using a modified version of my source code,
you must make those modifications available as well, even if you don't
distribute a binary version. The full license is in [LICENSE.txt.](LICENSE.txt)
If I end up making a reusable module for the network synchronization
functionality, I may release it under a more liberal license.
